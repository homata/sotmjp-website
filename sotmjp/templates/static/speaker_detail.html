                    <h2>About Jonathan Brendon</h2>
                    <p>Jean-Paul is a freelance programmer based in the north-eastern United States. He has been programming for over fifteen years and programming in Python for over ten - just long enough that he is beginning to get the hang of it. He was Divmod, Inc.'s second employee and worked there for years building context-sensitive, highly integrated communications servers. He also did brief stints at NIH and Deutsche Bank. He is best known as a core developer on the Twisted project.</p>
